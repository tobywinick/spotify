## Introduction

On January 1, 2024, I set out on a year-long project. Every new year, [r/dataisbeautiful](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/) users would post the culmination of their tracking of some aspect of their lives throughout an entire year, whether that be crying or drinking or average mood level. My idea was to create a playlist that I would add one song to each day of the year, to end up with a 366 (leap year!) song playlist that I could reflect on when the year is over. Songs were chosen if they were related to a day’s actions, such as “Come Sail Away” when I went on a cruise, listened to on repeat, or introduced to me by another, among other reasons. Overall, I felt this was a more reflective look at my year in listening than Spotify’s Wrapped, because of increases in both breadth and depth that it allowed.  

Throughout the year, I really took a step in listening to genres that were not rap. Unfortunately for my friends and family, this was in large part due to my newfound love for “Midwest Emo” (a convoluted genre, but generally used to describe emo music with indie rock/math rock influence) bands such as Modern Baseball and saturdays at your place. Having been chastised for how sad, whiny, and generally unlistenable my music was, I set out to analyze my year’s listening.  

At the end of the year, I had newly acquired R data analysis and visualization skills, and wanted to put them to work. My goal for this project was to navigate a dataset with a variety of variables, work on research skills such as recoding variables and cleaning datasets, and practice data visualization with *ggplot* and related functions.
